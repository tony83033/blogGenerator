Overview:
This platform automates the creation of blog posts for a news website based on YouTube videos. The goal is to streamline the process of creating news articles and opinion pieces by using AI to transcribe videos, generate drafts, 

How It Works:
1. **Video Upload Trigger**: 
   - 
   - manually provide a YouTube URL for any video you want to convert into a blog post.

2. **AI-Generated Content**: 
   - AI transcribes the video into text.
   - The system then summarizes the main points and creates a news article or opinion piece.
   - AI also generates the title and relevant tags for SEO.

3. **Manual Draft Control**: 
   - The system saves the blog post as a draft for you to review.
